# Plug-Scraper
<b>An advnace Plugable Based Scraper</b>

A Plugin Based Scraper with some extra features

Note: This is in beta phase (buggy) and requires fixes as I've used hackish methods (I think so) to make it work and you are free to clone and make pull requests

<b>Features:</b>
<ul>
<li>Completey Pluggable (Plugins to add support for various sites without toucing the main code)</li>
<li>New Modules can be added easily in the ./scraper/plugins folder</li>
<li> Pluggins can be reloaded or updated in runtime without stopping the program (This is applicable if you use this project with a api or bots so you can use the reload_plugins() function) </li>
<li>Data returned in a dictionary </li>
<li>The main imports are done in core module so the scraper plugin is as clean and readable as possible</li>
</ul>

<b>Languages Used:</b>
  1. Python

Thanks and you are always welcome to modify and make changes!
